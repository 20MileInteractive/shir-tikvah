					In these early years, kids start experiencing what being a Jewish child is about, through games, crafts, storytelling, dance, and drama, with children their same age. They learn about the Jewish holiday cycle and biblical characters, and simple prayers and blessings. Lots of singing, lots of activities, lots of fun.    
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>First grade</em> is about making new friends and learning about the major Jewish holidays. 
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Second graders</em> explore nature and ways of taking care of the earth and associated Jewish holidays and practices.    
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Third grade</em> focuses on holiday traditions. By then, children will be able to discuss the meaning of courage as it applies to the story of the Maccabees and to their own sense of Jewish identity. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Grades 1–3 meet on Sunday morning at a public school in Winchester, a five-minute drive from the Temple.

						While children are in the classroom, parents can have a cup of coffee and relax at the Parent Café, organized by the Parent Community Organization (PCO), a confederation of parents involved in planning activities that connect parents with other parents in grades 1–3.
