					From sunrise to sunset, from cradle to grave and all that lies in between, we celebrate, commemorate, and stand by each other as we experience the milestone events in our lives.  To mark these occasions, our rabbi and cantor work closely with our members to create meaningful Jewish ceremonies, based on tradition, multi-cultural and multi-faith practices, and family configurations.
				</p>
				<p>
					The joyous occasions include births and adoptions, baby namings and brises, bar and bat mitzvahs for children and for adults, marriages and weddings, and community observances.   These intensely personal experiences 
				</p>
				<p>
					At the other end of the spectrum are observances related to prolonged illnesses, chronic disabilities, and funerals, including attending to the needs of families before, during and after.   Members often have a shiva or a healing service in the intimate setting of their home after the death of a loved one, whether or not the funeral took place in or out of the area, whether it was Jewish or not. It gives us a chance to console the bereaved and deepen our communal memories.
