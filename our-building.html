				<p>It’s hard to believe, but our temple building used to be a Knights of Columbus and an American Legion hall! It took a lot of imagination  —  but with financial support from many generous members, a loan from a bank, and much creativity, the building was renovated, a porch added overlooking Wedge Pond, and a beautiful garden and surrounding grounds nurtured. </p>
	
				<p>Like all Shir Tikvah projects, the work involved many talented members who contributed to the renovation, including the interior frieze, the carvings on the <em>Bimah</em>, and the design of the building itself, which recalls shuls common to many Eastern European villages in the nineteenth century. The inside space is light and airy. <a href="#">Learn more about the building</a>. </p>
	
				<p>We love our temple home because it reflects who we are: welcoming and down-to-earth. </p>
