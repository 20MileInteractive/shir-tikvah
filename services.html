					<b>Friday night Shabbat Services</b><br/>
					Friday-night Shabbat services are communal, sacred experiences at Shir Tikvah, a respite from our busy weekday lives and concerns.  They are also joyful experiences, full of music, laughter, and camaraderie. We use a much beloved prayer book that contains English and Hebrew prayers, contemporary translations, commentary, and poetry. The services are fluid and soulful, and when they end, people linger, catching up with each other and, of course, eating at the casual oneg that follows.  During the summer months, services are led and organized by members.  Shabbat services begin at 7:30 pm and are open to all. 
				</p>

					<b>Monthly Friday Night Family Services</b><br/>
					These services are intended for the entire family to celebrate the joy of Shabbat.  Many are grade-based and planned in collaboration with the children and teachers in the religious school.  These services start at 6:30 pm and are preceded by a potluck dinner at 5:45 pm.  It’s always a full house.

					<b>Tot Shabbat</b><br/>
					Tot Shabbat is our drop-in Saturday morning Shabbat celebration designed for pre-readers, open to both members and non-members.  These hour-long get-togethers are friendly and fun—filled with song, prayer, dance, stories, and tot-oriented activities.  It’s a great way to meet other families with young children.  We meet on the first Saturday of each month at 10 am from October through June.  For more info, e-mail TotShabbat@shir-tikvah.org or call the office at 781-729-1263.

					<b>Saturday Service</b><br/>
					Shabbat services are held on Saturday morning or Saturday afternoon for bar and bat mitzvah ceremonies.  These are community services, and the congregation is always invited to participate in these joyous events.  On a number of Saturdays when there are no bar or bat mitzvahs scheduled, family-friendly services are planned in collaboration with the religious school.  These services integrate creative elements such as movement, drama, and meditation into the prayer experience. A potluck luncheon follows the service to which all community members are invited.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Havdalah</b><br/>
					Havdalah, Hebrew for “separation,” is a ritual that signals the separation between the holiness of Shabbat from ordinary weekdays. During the summer, our annual Dine, Daven, and Dunk Havdalah service is hosted at the home of one of our members and features a backyard picnic and swimming.  New members are particularly encouraged to attend this fun, family-friendly event.
