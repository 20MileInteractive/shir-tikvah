			<h1>High Holidays</h1>
			<p>
				The entire community comes together at Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur services to welcome the beginning of a new year and communally and personally reflect on the old.  Guided by the rabbi and cantor and with the active participation of the congregation, High Holiday services are a blend of ancient tradition with contemporary interpretation.  Music is a cornerstone of the services and is provided by our cantor, Shir Chadash (our member choir), members who are talented musicians, and the voices of the entire community.
			</p>
			<p>
				High Holiday services are held at Winchester Town Hall to accommodate the large turnout, a short walk from the temple building. There are also smaller, more intimate services available for families in the temple on the morning of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur should the town hall services feel too overwhelming, as well as an age-appropriate service for very young children.  Tickets are free for members and their children; additional tickets and tickets for non-members can be purchased ahead of time through the office.  
			</p>
			<p>
				A month or so before the high holidays, the dates, times and ticket information will be posted by the office.  Check the calendar and home page for High Holiday details or call the office for more information.
			</p>
			<h3>Holiday Celebrations</h3>
			<p>
				We celebrate holidays throughout the year including Sukkot, Simchat Torah, Hanukkah, Tu B'Shevat, Purim, and Passover.  Depending on when the holiday falls, we may observe the holiday at our Friday night service, during the week, or on a Sunday afternoon. Many of our holidays celebrations include special activities for families and children and are preceded by a potluck dinner. Please check the calendar for the date and times.
			</p>
			<p>
				Yizkor, the prayer recited by those who have lost a member of their family, is recited four times a year: on Yom Kippur, the last days of Pesach and Sukkot, and on Shavuot.
