			<h1>Early Childhood Programs</h1>
			<p>
				<b>Is it ever too early to begin?</b><br/>
				At Shir Tikvah, we think not. Our early childhood programs are excellent jumping off points for families that want to explore what it’s like to get involved in a Jewish community — perhaps for the first time — and to meet other families who are doing the same.  
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Tot Shabbat</b><br/>
				Tot Shabbat is a good place to start. Tot Shabbat is an early introduction to Jewish fun for infants, toddlers, pre-K kids, and their families. These lively get-togethers are a mix of singing, dancing, and story telling, followed by snacks and simple, age-appropriate craft projects. Tot Shabbats can be attended on a drop-in basis; temple membership is not required.

				Our <b>Experiencing Jewish Life</b> program (it’s a mouthful; we call it EJL) is for three- to five-year-olds and kindergartners focusing on the Jewish holidays. Children and parents start the morning singing songs and getting comfortable. Parents then go off to a parallel learning session of their own, and kids continue on in a pre-school or kindergarten class with their teachers.
			</p>
			<p>
				EJL helps families celebrate and explore Jewish holidays and related rituals, build a repertoire of Jewish experiences at home, and create a community for parents with kids of the same age. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Membership is not required, but preference is given to members.  This program fills up fast, so <a href="#">register early</a>.
