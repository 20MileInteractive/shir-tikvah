				<p>Shir Tikvah, then known as the Jewish Community of Winchester, was founded in 1978 by a small group of entrepreneurial families who came together to celebrate the Jewish holidays, as there was no synagogue in town. Renamed <em>Shir Tikvah</em> (“Song of Hope”), the group voted to affiliate with the Reform Movement and, as word spread, gradually gained members. Services were held in living rooms, community centers, and area churches. In 2000, after years of schlepping the Torah and boxes of prayer books from one venue to the next, the congregation moved into its new Vine Street home in Winchester, not far from where the first meetings to form a Jewish community had taken place twenty-two years before.</p>
