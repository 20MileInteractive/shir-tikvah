			<h1>Grade 7: Bar and Bat Mitzvah Year</h1>
			<p>
				During this important transitional year, the emphasis is on personal responsibility and ethical judgment. In addition to preparing for their bar or bat mitzvahs, seventh graders continue to learn about Jewish history, the Holocaust and other ethnic genocides, and participate in <a href="#"><b>Tikkun Olam</b></a> (repairing the world) activities.   
			</p>
			<p>
				Classes meet Wednesdays from 3:45 to 5:45 and for ten Sunday mornings for ethical decision-making classes. Bar and bat mitzvah tutoring begins approximately six months prior to the date.

					Parents continue to participate with their children. Seventh grade families, for example, volunteer monthly at a local church soup kitchen, preparing and serving meals to groups of 25-30 people. Parents also join their children to hear from a variety of speakers, including Holocaust survivors and representatives from social service agencies, such as the Mass. Coalition for the Homeless.
