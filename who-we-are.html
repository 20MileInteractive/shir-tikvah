		    	<p>Shir Tikvah is a mid-sized congregation of approximately 340 families and singles.  Our building is located in Winchester and many members live there, but most others come from at least 25 surrounding towns, including Arlington, Cambridge, Lexington, Medford, Melrose, Reading, and Wakefield. </p>
		
		    	<p>We are a feisty, thoughtful, questioning, down-to-earth, non-judgmental Jewish community of engaged members; representing different points of views, life-styles, income levels, religious backgrounds, and sexual/gender identities. We like to get to know each other and to listen to each other’s stories about our Jewish journeys — whether we are Jewish, Jewish by choice, or partnered with someone who is Jewish. From the community’s point of view, we are all in this together.</p>
		
		    	<p>We’re opinionated and skeptical at times.  We ask a lot of questions and get into long discussions. We struggle with the big issues in life. We’re also democratic, so that everyone gets a say. We’re collegial, generous, and — most of all — kind to each other. Oh, yes; we laugh a lot too — during services, at meetings, even at funerals and <em>shivas</em>. </p> 
		
		    	<p>We are each other’s extended family by choice.	</p>
