					In grades 4–6, kids start to explore the world outside the classroom by connecting the curriculum to the Temple community, the local community, and the greater world. The themes are <b>Caring</b>, <b>Tefillah</b> (prayer), and <b>B’nai Telem</b> (social action and service).   
				</p>
				<p>
					The curriculum in the <em>fourth grade</em> is centered on <b>caring</b>  — what it means to be a caring person — through action, prayers and customs, and understanding. Family education activities include interviewing members of the Caring Committee about the work they do, listening to temple members who have been helped by the <a href="#">Caring Committee</a>, making baby blankets for newborns, preparing a meal for an ill member, and learning about Jewish rituals, such as visiting a family in mourning at a <em>shiva</em>. 
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Fifth graders</em> learn about prayer, <b>T’fillah</b> — what it is, its many forms, and how to make their own prayer experience. Families participate in two creative and experiential Saturday morning Shabbat services planned by the students and their teachers, incorporating elements of music, poetry, meditation, and movement. Everyone in the community is invited to attend the service and the potluck lunch that follows.   
				</p>
				<p>
					The focus of the <em>sixth grade</em> is <b>B’nai Telem</b>, a program that gives kids opportunities to get involved in social action in six areas: poverty, hunger, literacy, connecting generations, special needs, and the environment. Kids will learn how these activities are based on values that have guided Jews for thousands of years.
				</p>
				<p>
					In preparation for their bar and bat mitzvahs, sixth graders and their parents also participate in a program called <b>Mitzvah Makers</b>, guided by the rabbi and cantor, intended to clarify values and to explore the meaning of Jewish adulthood.  There are also parent-only meetings to learn the ropes of the bar and bat mitzvah process and to share experiences. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Grades 4 and 5 meet on Tuesday from 3:45 to 5:45. Grade 6 meets on Wednesday from 3:45 to 5:45. All three grades also meet on Sunday mornings from 9:30 to 11.
