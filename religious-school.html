			<h1>Religious School</h1>
			<p>
				At Shir Tikvah, the Jewish education of our children is also a family education. They are inseparable. For our children to learn, we need to learn with them. In other words, we’re not a place where kids are dropped off and parents vanish.   
			</p>
			<p>
				Our strategy is twofold:  to involve parents —Jewish or not, parents with little or no Jewish background and parents with a lot — in meaningful learning activities with their kids and to create a friendly community for parents and a community of Jewish friends for their children. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Meanwhile, in the classroom, children are learning in a fun and supportive environment, through thematic programs that combine the curriculum with lots of activity and projects. By the time they reach bar and bat mitzvah age, they will be versed in Jewish history and values, have participated in numerous social action activities, and be on their way to creating their identities as Jewish young adults.      
			</p>
			<p>
				That’s what we do at the Shir Tikvah religious school. Sound like something your kids would like and that you would too?

					When we decide to give our kids a Jewish education, we do so with the hope that the experience will form the basis of a strong, positive Jewish identity that will last a lifetime.

					When a seventh grader, speaking for her class, explains, <b>“At Shir Tikvah, we can be Jewish people in our own way,”</b> we know we are doing something very right.
