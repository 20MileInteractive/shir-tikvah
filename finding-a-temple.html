			<h1>Finding A Temple That's Right For You</h1>
			<img src="http://placehold.it/1200x400&text=masthead+photo"/>
			<p>
			We're delighted that you want to explore Shir Tikvah and learn what membership could mean to you. And we're here to help you get started.
			</p>

			<p class="lead">
				No pressure. No rush.
			</p>

			<p>In fact, we want you to take some time with this decision because – like families – Jewish communities have different styles and ways of being together. So it's important to find a congregation that feels like a good match and that takes some time.
			</p>

			<h4>We encourage you to follow these 3 steps as you consider Shir Tikvah:</h4>
			
			<ol>
				<li><b>Think about what you want from a Jewish community.</b>
					<ul>
						<li>What level of observance is comfortable to you?</li>
						<li>Are you looking for Jewish learning, social action, spiritual growth, social connections, or all of these?</li>
						<li>How important is music?</li>
						<li>What size community appeals to you?</li>
						<li>Is a personal connection with the rabbi and/or cantor important?</li>
					</ul>			
				</li>
				<li><b>Get some basic facts about Temple Shir Tikvah.</b><br/>The information will help you put together a list of targeted questions about what's important to you. To learn more:
			
					<ul>
						<li>Take a spin through the rest of this website.</li>
						<li>Contact Membership@Shir-Tikvah.org and make a plan to talk with one of our members.</li>
						<li>Get in touch with our helpful office staff at Office@Shir-Tikvah.org or 781-729-1263 to request a membership packet and ask to talk with our Rabbi, School Director, or whoever else can best answer your questions.</li>
					</ul>

				</li>
			

				<li><b>Most important: "Date" us for a while to see if there's a connection.</b> You have an open invitation to the events on our calendar.
				</li>

			</ol>

			<h4>Not sure where to start?</h4>

			<p>
				We could just tell you that we are a vibrant, robust, warm, open, innovative, and diverse community. We could share how nontraditional families fit into Temple life and that non-Jewish members participate as fully as they'd like. We could tell a few stories about how belonging to Shir Tikvah has eased the bumps in our members' lives and made the good times even better. We could tell you great things because we love this place.
			</p>

			<p>
				But you need to come experience Shir Tikvah for yourself. Hear our Shabbat music. Taste our learning activities. Feel the essence of our holiday celebrations. See if you can imagine Shir Tikvah becoming your Jewish home. If you can, then you probably have found your match. And we welcome you to pull up a chair and make yourself at home.
			</p>
			<h4>Let us be your guide.</h4>

			<p>
				We’re ready to help you on your journey. Contact us to schedule a meeting, visit an event, or even just sit down to talk. Take the first step to find the right temple for you.
